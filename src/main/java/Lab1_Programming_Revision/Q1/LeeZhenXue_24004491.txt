My name is Lee Zhen Xue with matrix number, 24004491. I am 
majoring in Artificial Inteligent (AI). This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this 
subject. This is because I'm going to learn new things. 
I acquired A- for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will study hard. Wish me luck!!!
